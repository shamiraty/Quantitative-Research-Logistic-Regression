# QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION
# CATEGORICAL DATA

> Quantitative research deals with numbers, logic, and an objective stance. Quantitative research focuses on numeric and unchanging data and detailed, convergent reasoning rather than divergent reasoning
> in this video we will learn how to use Multiple Logistic Regression to check relationship between variables.  we suppose that, we answer research question from respondents collected questionnaires.  The nature of Collected data is Categorical data that a Logistic regression has a built-in class for data pre-processing, training and prediction
